#SELECT


Given a table of data, the most basic query we could write would be one that selects for a couple columns (properties) of the table with all the rows (instances).

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable;
```
The result of this query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, effectively a copy of the table, but only with the columns that we requested.


```sql
SELECT *
FROM mytable;
```
If we want to retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table, we can then use the asterisk (`*`) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.



# Queries with constraints (Pt. 1)
#WHERE


In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a `WHERE` clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.

```sql
SELECT column, another_column, ...
FROM mytable
WHERE condition
	AND/OR another_condition
	AND/OR ...;
```


More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous `AND` or `OR` logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2). And below are some useful operators that you can use for numerical data (ie. integer or floating point):

| Operator            | Condition                                            | SQL Example                   |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| =, !=, <, <=, >, >= | Standard numerical operators                         | col_name != 4                 |
| BETWEEN … AND …     | Number is within range of two values (inclusive)     | col_name BETWEEN 1.5 AND 10.5 |
| NOT BETWEEN … AND … | Number is not within range of two values (inclusive) | col_name NOT BETWEEN 1 AND 10 |
| IN (…)              | Number exists in a list                              | col_name IN (2, 4, 6)         |
| NOT IN (…)          | Number does not exist in a list                      | col_name NOT IN (1, 3, 5)     |



# Queries with constraints (Pt. 2)



When writing `WHERE` clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching. We show a few common text-data specific operators below:

| Operator   | Condition                                                                                             | Example                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| =          | Case sensitive exact string comparison (_notice the single equals_)                                   | col_name = "abc"                                                        |
| != or <>   | Case sensitive exact string inequality comparison                                                     | col_name != "abcd"                                                      |
| LIKE       | Case insensitive exact string comparison                                                              | col_name LIKE "ABC"                                                     |
| NOT LIKE   | Case insensitive exact string inequality comparison                                                   | col_name NOT LIKE "ABCD"                                                |
| %          | Used anywhere in a string to match a sequence of zero or more characters (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE) | col_name LIKE "%AT%"  <br>(matches "AT", "ATTIC", "CAT" or even "BATS") |
| _          | Used anywhere in a string to match a single character (only with LIKE or NOT LIKE)                    | col_name LIKE "AN_"  <br>(matches "AND", but not "AN")                  |
| IN (…)     | String exists in a list                                                                               | col_name IN ("A", "B", "C")                                             |
| NOT IN (…) | String does not exist in a list                                                                       | col_name NOT IN ("D", "E", "F")                                         |


> [!NOTE]
> All strings must be quoted so that the query parser can distinguish words in the string from SQL keywords.
